This tiny Perl script will parse Zaraf's Alchmey Recipe Guide, from GameFAQs, and generate dot graphs of the dependencies.

You can find the latest version of this alchemy guide here: http://www.gamefaqs.com/ds/937281-dragon-quest-ix-sentinels-of-the-starry-skies/faqs/60451

To run this, you need:
1) A recent version of Perl. Fortunately, no external modules were used.
2) Graphviz - http://www.graphviz.org/ or `sudo apt-get install graphviz`
